# ðŸ«€ SympTrack: AI-Powered Heart Health Insight Tool

SympTrack is an interactive web tool that allows users to input key health metrics and receive an AI-powered heart disease risk insight. Built with Streamlit and a trained logistic regression model on real-world heart disease data.

## Features
- Predicts **heart disease risk similarity** based on UCI Heart Disease dataset (Cleveland subset)
- Interactive **health metric inputs**
- Visualizes **top factors influencing each prediction**
- Full **feature contribution bar chart** for transparency
- **Model metrics:**  
  - Accuracy: 88%  
  - F1 Score: 86%  
  (F1 Score balances precision and recall â€” crucial for healthcare applications)

## Potential Applications
- Prototype for **clinical trial pre-screening tools**
- Early-stage **digital health app** concept
- Demonstration of **explainable AI in healthcare**

## How It Works
- A **logistic regression model** was trained on 13 features from the UCI dataset.
- User inputs are processed and fed to the model in real time.
- Outputs include:
  - A **risk similarity score**
  - **Top 3 contributing factors**
  - Full feature contribution visualization

## Disclaimer
This tool is for **educational purposes only** and does not provide medical advice.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Streamlit
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
